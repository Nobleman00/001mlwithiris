# Building first ML model using R

## Objective:

Project goal is to build a Machine Learning model using the `iris` dataset, which predicts the iris flower type based on the `sepal.length`, `sepal.width`, `petal.width` and `petal.length.`

## The Maching Learning Process goes through:

• Data Collection.

• Data Preparation and Evaluation.

• Model Building.

• Model Evaluation.
